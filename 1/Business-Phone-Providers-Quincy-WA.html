<p>Our Hosted Telephone Systems are hosted in the cloud, so you no longer have to stress over hardware or upkeep. This allows them to access features like auto attendants, on-hold music, call video, recording and voicemail-to-email conferencing that previously just big companies were using. Cloud-based phone systems are simple and quick to set-up because the system doesn't require wire rerouting.

VoIP offers small companies a platform to advertise themselves, thus improving their profile and business flow.</p>
